Apple eMac (ATI Graphics/USB 2.0/2005) CRT Controller

~~Here we go again... FML~~

This project is cancelled.

I broke the eMac in the course of tinkering with it by putting voltage to a place that did not want voltage. I scrapped it for parts and gave away the rest to a computer recycling center.

The pinouts, extracted firmware data, and EDID might be useful for someone out there so those will stay around. I don't plan on deleting anything, but this is the Internet and we all know how those promises play out...
