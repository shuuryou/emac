## WiFi Antenna

The WiFi antenna can be removed by removing front bezel and removing one screw that holds it at the top corner of the screen. Follow Apple Service Source instructions.

The front bezel is held by three __small__ screws on left and right sides, and two __small__ screws at the top (total of eight screws). There are no screws at the bottom that hold the front bezel and no plastic tabs that need to be bent.

**DO NOT** remove the large screws or the CRT will be permanently knocked out of alignment.

The front bezel can only be removed once the digital assembly (the entire MLB/HDD/CD container) has been removed fully.
